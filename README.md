## Highlights
- We use a probabilistic approach to derive the probability of improvement in Fisher’s geometric model of adaptation.
- Our approach provides an alternative interpretation of the main result of the model in terms of the model’s parameters.
- This probabilistic approach can be used to solve additional problems in Fisher’s geometric model.
